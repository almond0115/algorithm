## [[1286] Iterator for Combination](https://leetcode.com/problems/iterator-for-combination/)

Design the CombinationIterator class:

CombinationIterator(string characters, int combinationLength) Initializes the object 

with a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.

next() Returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.

hasNext() Returns true if and only if there exists a next combination.

## 제한 사항

1. 1 <= combinationLength <= characters.length <= 15
2. All the characters of characters are unique.
3. At most 104 calls will be made to next and hasNext.
4. It is guaranteed that all calls of the function next are valid.
