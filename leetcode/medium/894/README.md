## [[894] All Possible Full Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/)

Given an integer n, return a list of all possible full binary trees with n nodes. 

Each node of each tree in the answer must have Node.val == 0.

Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. 

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
